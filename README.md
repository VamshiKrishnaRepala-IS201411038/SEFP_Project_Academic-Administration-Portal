# ACAD - an Academic Administration Portal
  This is the repository for my Software Engineering course project ACAD - an Academic Administraiton Portal !!

# Motivation behind this project:
  Usually in our campus, Attendance of each student is taken manually by the staff/faculty
and entered this data into their machines and announce the students attended percentage individually
through mails for every month. Same problem happened in the case of course registration, making 
announcements, discussions etc. To resolve this tedious activities, We made a web based platform between
students, faculty and admin by following the traditional software development model - Waterfall model.
